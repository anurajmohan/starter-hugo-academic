abstract: 

# Summary. Money laundering is the process of concealing unlawfully obtained funds by presenting them as coming from a legitimate source. Criminals use crypto money laundering to hide the illicit origin of funds using a variety of methods. The most simplified form of bitcoin money laundering leans hard on the fact that transactions made in cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous, but open data gives more power to investigators and enables the crowdsourcing of forensic analysis. With the motive to curb these illegal activities, there exist various rules, policies and technologies collectively known as anti-money laundering (AML) tools. When properly implemented, AML restrictions reduce the negative effects of illegal economic activity while also promoting financial market integrity and stability, but these bear high costs for institutions. The purpose of this work is to motivate the opportunity to reconcile the cause of safety with that of financial inclusion, bearing in mind the limitations of the available data. The authors use the Elliptic dataset; to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the largest labelled transaction dataset publicly available in any cryptocurrency
