## 📌 Overview

This roadmap is designed for students starting Machine Learning from scratch.  
It is split into two phases:

- **Phase 1:** Foundations (Math + Python)
- **Phase 2:** ML Concepts + Practice + Mini Projects

---

## Phase 1: Machine Learning Foundations

---

#### ✅ Topics to Learn

**Linear Algebra**
- Vectors, matrices  
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors  

**Calculus & Gradients**
- Derivatives  
- Chain rule  
- Gradients  

**Probability & Statistics**
- Distributions  
- Expectation  
- Mean, variance

### 2) Python for Data Science

Students should become confident in using Python for data handling and visualization.

---

#### ✅ Skills Students Must Learn

- NumPy — numerical computing  
- Pandas — data manipulation  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn — visualization  
- scikit-learn — ML models (after ML basics)  
- PyTorch — deep learning (after DL basics)

---

## Phase 2: Machine Learning Concepts + Practice 

### 1) ML Core Concepts

Students should clearly understand:

- Features (X) and Target (y)  
- Train vs Test split  
- Overfitting vs Underfitting  

---

### 2) Models to Learn (Beginner Level)

Start with these 3 models:

- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  

Also learn the basics of:

**Representation → Loss Function → Optimization**

---

### 3) Evaluation Metrics

#### Regression Metrics
- MAE  
- MSE  
- RMSE  

#### Classification Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
